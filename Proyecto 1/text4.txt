i
could

but
i
began
to
feel
suspicious
of
this
dark
complexioned
harpooneer
at
any
rate
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
it
so
turned
out
that
we
should
sleep
together
he
must
undress
and
get
into
bed
before
i
did
supper
over
the
company
went
back
to
the
barroom
when
knowing
not
what
else
to
do
with
myself
i
resolved
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
as
looker
on
presently
rioting
noise
was
heard
without
starting
up
the
landlord
cried
thats
the
grampuss
crew
i
seed
her
reported
in
the
offing
this
morning
three
years
voyage
and
full
ship
hurrah
boys
now
well
have
the
latest
news
from
the
feegees
tramping
of
sea
boots
was
heard
in
the
entry
the
door
was
flung
open
and
in
rolled
wild
set
of
mariners
enough
enveloped
in
their
shaggy
watch
coats
and
with
their
heads
muffled
in
woollen
comforters
all
bedarned
and
ragged
and
their
beards
stiff
with
icicles
they
seemed
an
eruption
of
bears
from
labrador
they
had
just
landed
from
their
boat
and
this
was
the
first
house
they
entered
no
wonder
then
that
they
made
straight
wake
for
the
whales
mouthâthe
barâwhen
the
wrinkled
little
old
jonah
there
officiating
soon
poured
them
out
brimmers
all
round
one
complained
of
bad
cold
in
his
head
upon
which
jonah
mixed
him
pitchlike
potion
of
gin
and
molasses
which
he
swore
was
sovereign
cure
for
all
colds
and
catarrhs
whatsoever
never
mind
of
how
long
standing
or
whether
caught
off
the
coast
of
labrador
or
on
the
weather
side
of
an
iceisland
the
liquor
soon
mounted
into
their
heads
as
it
generally
does
even
with
the
arrantest
topers
newly
landed
from
sea
and
they
began
capering
about
most
obstreperously
i
observed
however
that
one
of
them
held
somewhat
aloof
and
though
he
seemed
desirous
not
to
spoil
the
hilarity
of
his
shipmates
by
his
own
sober
face
yet
upon
the
whole
he
refrained
from
making
as
much
noise
as
the
rest
this
man
interested
me
at
once
and
since
the
seagods
had
ordained
that
he
should
soon
become
my
shipmate
though
but
sleepingpartner
one
so
far
as
this
narrative
is
concerned
i
will
here
venture
upon
little
description
of
him
he
stood
full
six
feet
in
height
with
noble
shoulders
and
chest
like
cofferdam
i
have
seldom
seen
such
brawn
in
man
his
face
was
deeply
brown
and
burnt
making
his
white
teeth
dazzling
by
the
contrast
while
in
the
deep
shadows
of
his
eyes
floated
some
reminiscences
that
did
not
seem
to
give
him
much
joy
his
voice
at
once
announced
that
he
was
southerner
and
from
his
fine
stature
i
thought
he
must
be
one
of
those
tall
mountaineers
from
the
alleghanian
ridge
in
virginia
when
the
revelry
of
his
companions
had
mounted
to
its
height
this
man
slipped
away
unobserved
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
till
he
became
my
comrade
on
the
sea
in
few
minutes
however
he
was
missed
by
his
shipmates
and
being
it
seems
for
some
reason
huge
favourite
with
them
they
raised
cry
of
bulkington
bulkington
wheres
bulkington
and
darted
out
of
the
house
in
pursuit
of
him
it
was
now
about
nine
oclock
and
the
room
seeming
almost
supernaturally
quiet
after
these
orgies
i
began
to
congratulate
myself
upon
little
plan
that
had
occurred
to
me
just
previous
to
the
entrance
